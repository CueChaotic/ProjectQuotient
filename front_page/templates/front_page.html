            We're a group of gamers, here to make games. We weren't too
            happy with the quality of the stuff being put out there, so
            we wanted to see if we could do better. We wanted to craft
            games centered around strong and well-developed narratives,
            characters that you love and love to hate, exploring from the
            deepest oceans to the furthest frontiers of the Milky Way. Not
            only do we want you to be able to witness clashing empires
            across the course of human history, on Earth and worlds afar;
            but also explore the stories and journeys of characters that
            you can grow fond of.<br>
            <br>
            History isn't just made here, it's forged to perfection.
            <br>

            From Patrick and the team at PROJECT/QUOTIENT</b></p>
